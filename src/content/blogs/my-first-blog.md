I've always wanted to write blogs. Sharing various experiences with world. I was never able to do that because how lazy I am. But better late than never.

## What would I write about?

To begin with, I am planning to write about things I learn everyday. These days I am deeply involved with Azure Kubernetes and other container technologies. I will write about them. In past few months, I've learned a lot about web development. I will write about that. And may be more.

## How often would I write?

I dont want to promsie. I will do my best to write atleast one blog each week.
